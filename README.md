## Disclaimer

Please don't use this addon. It contains a nasty hack that works for us, because
we can't use Ember CLI's HTTP Mocks API until some changes to Ember CLI
around how it loads configuration.

We have a somewhat unique situation in how our build system is used, and chances
are that you can probably just use Ember CLI's HTTP Mocks. Please look at them
first before you consider using this.
